This week I challenged myself a lot in knowledge that I still didn't have and needed to learn in some way ... So, what is the best way to learn? In practice, obviously! I decided to create a Machine Learning model from data analysis to deployment in a web application, which was done using Flask in Docker within an EC2 from Amazon Web Services.

Although very simple, both analysis and modeling, I was very happy with the overall performance of the project. Below, I list some themes I used, as I found a very complete solution:

- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Creating different Models for Evaluation
- Cross Validation to Choose the Best Model
- Final Model Tunning
- Deploy
- Docker
- EC2 / AWS

Anyway, I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed developing it during the week, on my Github is available the jupyter notebook (in English, but the next one I do in Portuguese) and the other scripts used, as well as other older projects.
